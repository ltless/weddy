# ░▒▓  The Nexus Strain  ▓▒░

A fragmented reality. A symphony of silence. A world consumed by shadows.

**Where Time Fractures**

Elysia. A name that whispers on the wind, a ghost of a world lost to the abyss.  A place where the boundaries between light and darkness blurred, where the echoes of the past intertwined with the whispers of the future.  But the threads of time have frayed, and the tapestry of reality has unraveled.

**The CORE's Embrace**

A contagion of whispers, a symphony of screams. The CORE devours, twists, and corrupts, leaving only hollow shells in its wake.  The infected dance to a silent tune, their eyes vacant, their bodies contorted.  Elysia bleeds, its lifeblood seeping into the void.

**LTL-001: A Witness in the Shadows**

A fractured consciousness, a shattered mirror reflecting a broken timeline.  LTL-001, the Chronomaestro, drifts through the remnants of a lost world, their memories fragmented, their purpose unclear.  They see the past, the present, and the future intertwined, a chaotic dance of possibilities and despair.

**The Abyss Beckons**

Descend into the depths of a dying world, where secrets whisper and shadows dance.  Unravel the enigma of the CORE, the mystery of the Nexus, and the desperate gamble of Project Nightfall.  But tread carefully, for the abyss gazes back, and its echoes can consume even the most vigilant observer.
